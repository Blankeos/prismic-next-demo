# Prismic + Next.js Blog Starter

## Getting Started

```sh
pnpm install
npx @slicemachine/init@latest
pnpm dev
```

## Carlo's Notes

### 1. What are the major building blocks of the stack?

- **Slice Machine**

  - It's basically the schema builder (if you used Prisma). They're like the
    columns/datatypes defined for your content.
  - You make **document types** and **slices** here.
    - **Document Types** - they're the collections.
    - **Slices** - they're what you put inside document types. You can specify
      which slices are allowed in document types.
  - Those types actually live inside this project's folder as well in `customtypes` folder.
    Which means they get saved on your git.
  - It only runs on localhost. `npm:slicemachine`.

- **CMS**

  - This is where you add "content". They're like the rows/data for your content.
  - It runs on your Prismic Repository (tenant page).
  - The data lives in Prismic's datacenters. You pretty much can't migrate it. (Vendor-locked)
  - I noticed that if you check slicemachine.config.json and see
    `repositoryName: 'margaret-blog`. Your CMS will be running on `margaret-blog.prismic.io`.

- **The Website**
  - This is just the Next.js Project here. Already very familiar.
  - Runs on localhost (npm:next:dev), or just deploy it duh.

### 2. What makes it different from a regular Next Project?

These are pretty much the only things that you need to turn a Next.js project
into a Prismic + Next.js project.

#### Files/Directories

- `customtypes` folder (Where Slice Machine data gets saved)/
- `src/slices` folder (React Components that render the slice data).
- `slicemachine.config.json` config file. "repositoryName" is the most important here.
- `prismicio.js`

  - Exports "client". This is the prismic client sdk (if you don't want to interact
    with REST APIs, Kinda like Firebase, Supabase, Pocketbase SDKs).
  - Exports routes for pages document types.
  - Exports prismic repo name

- `prismicio-types.d.ts` Slice machine generated types.
- Page: `slice-simulator` page in Next.js, add this to simulate slices
  in real-time as you edit thme. Use thsi alongisde src/slices when making slices.

#### General Workflow

I will write the actual 'script' that runs this, not just the 'script aliases'
in package.json.

- `npx @slicemachine/init@latest` MOST IMPORTANT. Always do this for new
  projects. It does two things:
  - Login to Prismic
  - Connects your project to the Prismic Repository.
  - Basically takes care of `slicemachine.config.json` for you.
- `start-slicemachine` to run the slice machine dev server (always locally).
- `prismic-ts-codegen` to run codegen for prismicio-types.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To start a new project using this starter, run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npx degit prismicio-community/nextjs-starter-prismic-blog your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npx @slicemachine/init@latest
```

The commands will do the following:

1. Start a new Next.js project using this starter.
2. Ask you to log in to Prismic or [create an account][prismic-sign-up].
3. Create a new Prismic content repository with sample content.

When you're ready to start your project, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
